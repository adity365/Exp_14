## Inheritance 
In general programming, **inheritance** is a concept where one class (called a subclass or derived class) inherits the properties and behaviors (methods) of another class (called a superclass or base class). In OOP, the types of inheritance are:

1. **Single Inheritance**: A subclass inherits from one superclass.
   
2. **Multiple Inheritance**: A subclass inherits from more than one superclass.
   
3. **Multilevel Inheritance**: A subclass inherits from a class that itself inherits from another class.
   
4. **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple subclasses inherit from a single superclass.
   
5. **Hybrid Inheritance**: A combination of two or more types of inheritance (e.g., multiple and multilevel).

These types help create a structured and reusable class hierarchy in object-oriented programming.
